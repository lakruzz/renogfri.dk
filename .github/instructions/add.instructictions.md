When I tell you that I'm getting ready to leave this chat and start a new. Please take everything you have learned from this chat and write up an instructions file for yourself. Put it in a new `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` file or add it to an existing if you can find a fit.

The purpose is that I should not have to explain myself to you next time we run into this topic.

Open the instruction you created ort altered in the editor, so I can review it before we commit it.
