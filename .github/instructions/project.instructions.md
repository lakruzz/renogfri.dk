# Project: Ren & Fri Website (`renogfri.dk`)

This is a static website for a Danish citizen's proposal ("borgerforslag") advocating for 0% VAT on raw food ingredients.

## Project-Specific Code

- **JavaScript (`src/assets/js/main.js`)**: The site uses vanilla JavaScript for interactive elements. Key features include:
  - A simple VAT "database" and checker in the `appState` object and `checkMoms` function.
  - A chart displaying cost analysis, initialized by `initCostChart`.
- **Research (`research.index.html`)**: This file contains specific research and data related to the proposal.
- **AI Research Context**: For more detailed context on the project's vision, economic data, and scientific basis (like the NOVA classification), refer to `research.instructions.md`.
